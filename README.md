# Introduction
LD06 is mainly composed of laser ranging core, wireless transmission unit, wireless communication unit, angle measuring unit, motor driving unit and mechanical housing. The LD06 ranging core adopts DTOF technology to measure 4500 times each second. When it works, LD06 emits the infrared laser forward, the laser is reflected to the single photon receiving unit after encountering the target object. Thus, we get both time of laser emitting and receiving, the gap between them is time of flight. With the light speed, we can calculate the distance. After receiving distance data, LD06 will combine them with angel value getting from angle measurement unit to comprise the points cloud data, then transmitting the points cloud data to external interface via wireless communication. Meanwhile the external interface provides PWM to allow motor driving unit to drive the motor. After the external control unit gets the rotational speed , it will reach to specified speed through PID algorithm closed-loop control to ensure LD06 work stably.
